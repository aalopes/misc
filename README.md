Miscellaneous stuff

Different stuff which do not fit anywhere else.
At the moment there's the following 
* iPXE script for booting Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (tested on Desktop version)
* preseed for installing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (tested on Desktop version) 
* post-install script example

(so only stuff for a Debian/Ubuntu automated installation)
